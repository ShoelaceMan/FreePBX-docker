;mode=old   ; method for playing numbers and dates
		    ; old - using asterisk core function
		    ; new - using this configuration file

; The new language routines produce strings of the form
;	prefix:[format:]data
; that are matched against the rules in this file to produce
; an output.
;
; The data is generally the string to be spelled (either a number,
; an ascii string or a date/time in the format specified below).
; It is available, in the right hand side of a rule, as variable ${SAY}.
;
; The format is optional and normally used only for date/time.
; The prefix is used to select the pronunciation - standard
; prefixes are
;	num		used for numbers
;	enum		used for enumerations
;	date 		for dates
;	time 		for times
;	datetime	for dates and times
;	char		for character strings
;	phonetic	for phonetic strings
;	digit		for digit strings
;
; but others can be used at will.
;
; Processing occurs as follows:
; If the format is empty, or there is no format, the entire
; string is matched against one of the pattern on the left hand side.
; On the first match, the various comma-separated components on the right
; hand side are pronounced, as follows:
; + a component starting with a prefix: (i.e. with a ':' in it)
;   is re-processed according to these rules;
; + a component without a ':' in it is considered a filename and
;   the corresponding file is played.
;
; If the format is non-empty, the format is split into its components
; (individual characters, or filenames in single quotes), and then
; filenames are played, whereas single characters are used to
; generate a new string format:pat:data to be processed.
;
; DATES/AND TIMES assume that the date info is available in
; the form	 YYYYMMDDHHmm.ss-dow-doy
; with 4 digits for the year, 2 for month, day, hour, minutes, seconds,
; one digit for the day-of-week, and 3 digits for the day-of-year.
;
; Example:
;     datetime::200604172030.00-4-102
; (typical format for a date) is first matched against the line
;	datetime::. => date:AdBY 'digits/at' IMp:${SAY}
; which is normally present with the default format for dates.
; In turn, the format string "AdBY 'digits/at' IMp" results in
; the sequence
;	date:A:200604172030.00-4-102
;	date:d:200604172030.00-4-102
;	date:B:200604172030.00-4-102
;	date:Y:200604172030.00-4-102
;	digits/at
;	date:I:200604172030.00-4-102
;	date:M:200604172030.00-4-102
;	date:p:200604172030.00-4-102
;
;
; Remember, normally X Z N are special, and the search is
; case insensitive, so you must use [X] [N] [Z] .. if you
; want exact match.

; We start with the basic rules that might be more-or-less
; language-independent
